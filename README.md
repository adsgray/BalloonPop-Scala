# BalloonPop-Scala

A balloon popping Android game written (mostly) in Scala and work-in-progress. It uses blobengine
which is in the [AndroidGDX](https://github.com/adsgray/AndroidGDX) repository
and which is 100% Java.

It will be timed (how many balloons can you pop in 1 minute?) and kid-friendly
(read: easy).


### TODO:
1. Tag blobengine when changes settle
2. BlobengineUtil.scala to wrap triggers, sources, etc
3. font
4. sounds
5. time limited game with countdown
6. high scores (top 5, also top 5 score/taps ratio)
